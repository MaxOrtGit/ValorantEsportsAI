# Valorant Esports AI

This program uses a variety of models on sklearn to predict the outcome of Valorant esports matches. I created the datasets by webscraping (with permission) vlr.gg. The odds were collected overtime with my VCT Predictions Bot while the rest of the stats are collected in the Scaper.ipynb file.

The accuracy from the model ended up matching the accuracy of the betting odds, which is around 62%. I also created a model that predicts the odds. Much more information can be found in EsportsAI.ipynb.
